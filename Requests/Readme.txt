Please find enclosed the Brain and VNC data used in our study. Both directories contain the following:

- 'ExtractedImages' : Mask files generated from each clone in both males and females
- 'RawLSMs' : Confocal stacks
- 'Registrations' : Settings and logs of registrations
- 'SuccessfullyRegistered' : Tissues after registration
- A csv spreadsheet ExportedImageRecords.txt which includes additional information about the images used

In addition there is another spreadsheet called CloneList.csv which includes details of all the clones that we annotated for each brain/VNC.
  - The brains are identified by the BrainKey field and this can be cross-matched with the LSM files.  
  - UniqueID is a unique id for each clone and can be used as a reference if you ever need to discuss a specific clone with us.
  - CloneName contains the standardised name for each clone as used in Cachero, Ostrovsky et al. doi:10.1016/j.cub.2010.07.04.  See the SI of that paper for further details about the naming scheme.
